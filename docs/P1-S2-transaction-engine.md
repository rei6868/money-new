# P1-S2: Transaction Engine Implementation

## Overview
Implemented the core Transaction Engine v1 that powers the financial management system with ledger-based architecture.

## Changes Made

### 1. Project Rename
- Renamed project from `money-new` to `gemini-money` in `package.json`
- Updated repository references in `README.md`

### 2. Transaction Engine (`POST /api/transactions`)
Enhanced the existing endpoint with complete financial impact processing:

#### Core Features
- **Atomic Transactions**: All database operations wrapped in transactions (using Drizzle ORM)
- **Event-Based Architecture**: Transactions table stores only the event, impacts recorded in separate ledgers

#### Financial Impact Processing

**A. Debt Logic** (Already implemented, verified)
- Detects transactions with `person_id` and `debtMovement` payload
- Creates/updates `debt_ledger` entries per person+cycle
- Records individual events in `debt_movements` table
- Supports movement types: `borrow`, `repay`, `discount`
- Calculates net debt: `initialDebt + newDebt - repayments - debtDiscount`

**B. Cashback Logic** (Newly implemented)
- Processes transactions with `cashbackMovement` payload
- Supports two calculation types:
  - `percent`: Applies percentage to transaction amount (e.g., 1.5% = 1.5)
  - `fixed`: Direct currency amount
- Creates/updates `cashback_ledger` per account+cycle (YYYY-MM format)
- Records individual cashback events in `cashback_movements`
- Enforces budget caps:
  - Status `applied` when within budget
  - Status `exceed_cap` when budget exceeded
  - Automatically caps cashback amount to remaining budget
- Updates ledger aggregates:
  - `totalSpend`: Sum of qualifying transactions
  - `totalCashback`: Sum of credited cashback
  - `remainingBudget`: Budget cap minus total cashback
  - `eligibility`: Tracks if account reached cap

**C. Account Balance Updates** (Newly implemented)
- Updates `currentBalance` based on transaction type
- Maintains running totals:
  - `totalIn`: Sum of income/repayment/cashback
  - `totalOut`: Sum of expense/debt
- Transaction type handling:
  - Income/Repayment/Cashback: Increases balance
  - Expense/Debt: Decreases balance

### 3. API Request Format

```json
{
  "occurredOn": "2024-01-15",
  "amount": 150000,
  "type": "expense",
  "status": "active",
  "accountId": "uuid",
  "personId": "uuid",
  "categoryId": "uuid",
  "notes": "Transaction notes",
  "debtMovement": {
    "movementType": "borrow",
    "cycleTag": "2024-01"
  },
  "cashbackMovement": {
    "cashbackType": "percent",
    "cashbackValue": "1.5",
    "budgetCap": "500000"
  }
}
```

### 4. Database Schema
Leverages existing Drizzle ORM schemas:
- `transactions`: Main event table
- `debt_movements`: Individual debt events
- `debt_ledger`: Aggregated debt per person+cycle
- `cashback_movements`: Individual cashback events
- `cashback_ledger`: Aggregated cashback per account+cycle
- `accounts`: Account balances and totals

## Architecture Principles

1. **Ledger-Based**: Transactions are immutable events; impacts recorded separately
2. **Atomic Operations**: All related records created/updated in single transaction
3. **Cycle-Based Aggregation**: Financial data aggregated by YYYY-MM cycles
4. **Budget Enforcement**: Cashback caps enforced at creation time
5. **Audit Trail**: All movements linked to originating transaction

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test basic transaction creation
2. Test debt movement creation and ledger updates
3. Test cashback calculation (percent vs fixed)
4. Test cashback budget cap enforcement
5. Test account balance updates
6. Test cycle rollover scenarios
7. Test concurrent transaction handling

## Next Steps

1. Add transaction validation middleware
2. Implement transaction rollback/void functionality
3. Add ledger reconciliation jobs
4. Implement transfer transaction logic
5. Add comprehensive error handling
6. Create integration tests
7. Add API documentation with examples
