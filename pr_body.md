## Highlights
- Delivered responsive transactions history page consuming live `/api/transactions` + `/api/transactions/columns` with dynamic columns, cashback data, selection totals, and CRUD stubs (`pages/transactions-history.js`, `styles/TransactionsHistory.module.css`).
- Simplified sidebar navigation to finance-focused sections and added placeholders for People, Debt, and Cashback routes (`components/Sidebar.js`, `pages/people.js`, `pages/debt.js`, `pages/cashback/*`).
- Added column customizer, filter/add modals, and advanced row actions with persistent `data-testid` hooks for Cypress coverage.

## Cypress & Test Logs
- npm run lint (pass)
- Cypress spec: `cypress/e2e/transactions-history.spec.js` (search, filter, selection, column panel flows).

## Notes & Follow-ups
- UI currently posts to stubbed API handlers; wire to Neon-backed mutations once BE endpoints are production-ready.
- Column defaults + mandatory map mirror API metadata; update `MANDATORY_COLUMNS` if the schema evolves.
- Screenshot placeholder: capture desktop layout with selection bar + column panel before publishing PR.
